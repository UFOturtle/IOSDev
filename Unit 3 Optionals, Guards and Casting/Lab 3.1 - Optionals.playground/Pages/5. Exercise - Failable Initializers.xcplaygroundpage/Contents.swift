 ## Exercise - Failable Initializers
 
 Create a `Computer` struct with two properties, `ram` and `yearManufactured`, where both parameters are of type `Int`. Create a failable initializer that will only create an instance of `Computer` if `ram` is greater than 0, and if `yearManufactured` is greater than 1970, and less than 2017.

 Create two instances of `Computer?` using the failable initializer. One instance should use values that will have a value within the optional, and the other should result in `nil`.
